# Wisconsin per-pupil comparative cost analysis
A sample script for cleaning and exploring comparative cost per pupil in Wisconsin school districts and generating gifs displaying longitudinal data for three key metrics:

* Total Current Educational Cost (TCEC). This measure captures overall instructional and instructional support service costs attributable to district resident students, excluding transportation, facility acquisition expenditures, and services the district provides to nonresident pupils.

* Total Education Cost (TEC). This measure captures TCEC plus transportation and  expenditures for facility acquisitions.

* Total District Cost (TDC). This measure captures TEC plus food and community service costs.
